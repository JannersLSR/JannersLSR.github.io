### How you accomplished each item in the criteria except for README file discussion:

Sadly by the looks of it I did not, even though I was really guided throughout the process. In the future, I vow to polish out my skills in website programming.

### Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1):

It has made me refresh my memory on the basic fundamentals of programming, while adding a bit of spice with the introduction HTML, CSS, and Javascript languages. It has also introduced me to Git and Github, which for me looked so intimidating from a beginning programmers standpoint, but after grasping the gist of it, it's not as bad (yet).

### Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1):

The biggest struggle I still deal with is, the design and placement for elements in CSS programming. 

### How you could improve your website in the future:

At first the expectations that I had when making this was just going to be a one and done thing, that's why it focuses on my interest, but after spending time on my website, I gradually came to the conclusion that I do want to make it more professional in the next coming years. 

### Other thoughts that might be noteworthy:

I am terrible at palettes and trying to make other devices compatible with my website.
